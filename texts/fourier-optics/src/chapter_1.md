# Failures in teaching Fourier Optics

If you are a physics or engineering student, then you might have heard that a lens can compute a Fourier transform. Unfortunately, if you are like the majority of students that I have mentored, then you are likely unable to explain what exactly this means.

But don't worry! You are not alone. Fourier Optics is considered a difficult subject, full of long equations and tedious calculations. I believe that the reason for this is not due to the inherent difficulty of the subject matter. Rather, Fourier Optics is made to seem more difficult than it is because instructors rely too heavily on equations when, in fact, an emphasis on the geometry of optical systems would be better. To make matters worse, learning material in Fourier Optics often fails to identify connections between what you already know. "What is a spatial frequency?" and "How does it relate to a plane wave?" are questions that you can already answer if you are familiar with Fourier series and electromagnetism, and they are foundational questions in Fourier Optics.

In this book I'm going teach you Fourier Optics in a way that is different than it is normally taught. I am going to focus on concepts and geometry, and I will start from what you already know. Furthermore, I'm going to emphasize what I think are the useful parts of the subject. I work in an experimental biophysics lab where we use and develop light microscopes. Fourier Optics has helped me immensely in my day-to-day work, but not everything from the subject is useful.

Finally, I'd like to also teach you about the computational aspects of the subject. These days, the performance of optical systems is being augmented by computer code and algorithms. These algorithms have Fourier Optics as their foundation. Plus, it is entirely feasible to simulate and understand certain aspects optical systems in only a few lines of code, so why not discuss this important topic?
