Different illumination modalities for epi-fluorescence imaging. Epi-illumination illuminates the whole sample at once so that out-of-focus fluorescence contributes to the background. HILO illuminates the sample with a thin light sheet. Only regions of the sample within the light sheet will fluoresce. Finally, in TIRF, the illumination is totally internally reflected at the coverslip so that only regions of the sample within one wavelength of the coverslip are illuminated.
