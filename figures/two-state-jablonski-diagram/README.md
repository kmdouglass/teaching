Jablonski diagram of a fluorophore. Absorption of a photon causes a transition from the ground (S0) state to the excited (S1) state on time scales of roughly 1e-15 seconds. The fluorophore then relaxes through several closely-spaced vibrational states on time scales of approximately 1e-12 seconds. From there, the fluorophore can decay back to the ground state. If it is a radiative decay, then a photon is emitted. Due to the energy lost during internal conversion, its wavelength is longer than the wavelength of the incident photon. Alternatively, the fluorophore can lose energy through non-radiative means. The average time spent in the excited state is typically on the order of 1e-9 seconds.
