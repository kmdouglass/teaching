Three state model of fluorescence photoswitching. Rate coefficients between states are denoted by k's. k_off is a function of light irradiance at the fluorophore. Photons are emitted from the fluorophore when it is in the ON state, but not when it is in the OFF state or the BLEACHED state. Once bleached, a fluorophore will remain that way forever.
