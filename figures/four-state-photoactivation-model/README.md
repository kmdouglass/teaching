Four state model of fluorescence photoactivation. Rate coefficients between states are denoted by k's. k_a, the activation rate, is a function of light irradiance at the fluorophore in the UV part of the spectrum; k_off is a function of irradiance in the visible part of the spectrum. Photons are emitted from the fluorophore when it is in the ON state, but not when it is in the INACTIVE, OFF, or the BLEACHED states. Once bleached, a fluorophore will remain that way forever.
