The number of significant bits due to photon shot noise increases with camera well capacity. Two different pixels are shown: one with a well capacity of 1000 electrons, and one with a well capacity of 1e6 electrons. The pixel is ideal: it's linear, has a quantum efficiency of 1, and the 12-bit ADC outputs its maximum value of 4095 ADUs at precisely the point the pixel becomes saturated with electrons. In the case of a pixel with a 1000 electron well capacity, the noise level is sqrt(1000) = 32 electrons. This corresponds to a photon signal of 32 photons, which fills the first 7 bits of the ADC. In the other case, the noise is sqrt(1e6) = 1000 electrons. Here, however, the fluctuant part of the signal occupies the first three bits of the ADC. All else being equal, a higher well capacity leads to pixels having a larger number of significant bits and, therefore, a larger information capacity.
