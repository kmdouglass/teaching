The Bragg Condition

When X-rays are incident upon a crystal, some of their energy is reflected from each plane of the crystalline lattice. The reflected wavefronts travel an increasing distance to the detector for each successive plane of reflection. Certain angles of incidence result in distances that differ by integer multiples of the X-ray wavelength, and these angles will lead to the observation of diffraction peaks due to constructive interference between the reflected wavefronts.

The Bragg condition applies to topics beyond just X-ray diffraction. In optics, a weakly scattering, transilluminated specimen viewed by a microscope can be thought of as a superposition of many volume gratings with distinct periods and orientations. Light that is scattered from the specimen and subsequently collected by the microscope's objective lens must have satisfied the Bragg condition for at least one of these volume gratings. And since specimens vary considerably in size, shape, and content, they will contain many gratings that all satisfy the Bragg condition for the same illumination angle.

The above discussion leads to an important conclusion: the image formed by a microscope contains information about the specimen in the form of gratings from which light was simultaneously scattered into the aperture of the objective lens and that satisfied the Bragg condition.
