# 3D Aperture

Microscopes cannot form a perfect image of a specimen due to fundamental limits on their resolving power. As a result, we are left with blurry images that obscure important details about the specimen, such as the sizes, shapes, and compositions of organelles inside a cell.

In these videos I show how to use the Ewald sphere to construct the resolution limits of a transilluminated, microscopic object under coherent and partially coherent illumination. The volume of the object's spatial frequency spectrum that is captured by the microscope is known as the 3D aperture, and its nonzero elements are its support.

The construction of the 3D aperture provides us not only a way to describe a microscope's resolution limits, but also the means to attempt the recovery of those lost details.
