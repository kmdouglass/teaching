## Image formatting

The following are the guidelines I use to create figures. Not all images follow these rules.

Sketches and illustrations are saved as Inkscape SVGs.

Some browsers will not render some SVG features such as arrowheads, so it might be necessary to download images to see them in their entirety.

## Sizes

I create images in the following sizes. If you need a different size, then download and rescale an image with Inkscape or a similar vector graphics program.

### Widths

- Single column: 90 mm
- 1.5 columns: 140 mm
- Double column: 180 mm

## DPI

- Sketches: 300
- Raster: 600

## Font

- Arial, 8 pt
